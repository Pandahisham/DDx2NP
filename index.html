<h1>Introduction</h1>

DDx2NP framework is an API oriented to the generation of <a
href="http://nanopub.org">nanopublications</a> of diagnosis knowledge bases
schemas or diagnosis results. It allows, for a concrete knowledge base or
diagnosis source information, the creation of the associated nanopub following
the diagnosis nanopub model.

<h1>Diagnosis nanopub model</h1> The Diagnosis nanopub model has been created to
provide a reference model to store clinical diagnosis knowledge using
nanopublications. The model is divided in two submodels: <em>Diagnosis Knowledge
Base Definition Model</em> and <em>Diagnosis Process Definition Model</em>. In
order to link the different entities that are represented in both models, as
part of the semantic representation we make use of the Diagnosis Definition
Ontology (DDxDO), which can be consulted in more detail here.

 <h2>Diagnosis Knowledge Base Definition Model</h2> The Diagnosis Knowledge Base
 Definition Model (DKBD Model) has been created to provide a real structure about
 how the diagnostic criteria of the diseases are conformed, also known as
 Diagnostic Criterion Model (DCM) [1]. DKBD uses the DCM model as a way to create
 relations between the disease and the associated criteria (clinical findings).
 The basic representation of this model, using DDxDO to create the relationships,
 can be seen on the following Figure:   <br /><br /> <img src="fig1.png"

 The definition of a disease is the definition done by a physician/system about
 a disease in a concrete moment. For each disease-physician/system pair 
 several definitions could exist, based on several factors (that should be reflected in
 publication info data). This schema allows having multiple definitions of a same
 disease made by several physicians or systems. In the left part of the schema we
 have a nanopublication collection to define a disease. This nanopublication
 collection is linked with other nanopublications through the
 has_clinical_finding relationships, following the DCM model. The nanopublication
 collection is a set of nanopublications with shared publication info. Each
 nanopublication inside the nanopublication collection has a set of assertions
 and provenance data that makes reference to the entire nanopublication. In the
 model, each nanopublication which belongs to the nanopublication collection
 contains information about the clinical finding that has been asserted to “be
 part” of the disease. In the assertion part of the nanopublication, we will have
 a definition of this relation through the has_clinical_finding relation, being
 the object (or end) of this relation, the nanopublication that is out of the
 collection. Provenance data will contain information regarding the assertion of
 the nanopublication of the nanopublication collection. On the other hand, the
 nanopublications that are out of the nanopublication collection contain more
 specific data about the clinical finding. Basically, they can contain different
 types of relations with the finding (has_sign, has_diagnostic_test,
 has_disorder, etc…) depending the type of clinical finding, and other provenance
 information regarding this relation. The following figure shows a more detailed example of
 this model; we can see a hypothetical example of a disease
 definition using this model: 
 
 <br /><br /> <img src="fig2.png" width="1061"

 As can be seen in this figure, we have the definition of disease <i>sn:458</i> (<i>sn</i> stands for SNOMED namespace). 
 In the nanopub collection we have included two nanopubs. The second one (sn:dx458:def:a413f:np2) is a nanopub 
 that contains an assertion about the clinical finding that has been described as “part of” the disease, in this definition (def:a413f). 
 The relation points to the nanopub “sn:dx458:def:b4fc7:np2:cf:cd4e” through the has_clinical_finding relation. 
 In the provenance section, we have some information regarding this assertion in this context. Imagine for example that 
 the physician that describes these relationships (Dr. Sheldon Cooper, as publication info showed up), said that the 
 probability of manifesting the clinical finding “cd4e” (which is nausea and vomiting if we check  nanopublication sn:dx458:def:b4fc7:np2:cf:cd4e) 
 in sn:dx458 is 80%. This information will be added in the provenance of this nanopublication. On the right side, we have the nanopublications 
 that contain the real information about the findings pointed by the nanopublications of the nanopublication collection. In the assertion section, 
 we have the relation with the type of clinical finding (for example, in sn:dx458:def:b4fc7:np2:cf:cd4e the relation is has_sign), and the clinical
  finding itself (nausea). Additional provenance information the sign will be added in provenance section. Finally, the following figure shows the definition of 
  the same disease performed by two different physicians following DKBD Model:

<h2> Diagnosis Process Definition Model</h2> 

The DiagnosiseProcesshDefinitioneModel (DPD Model) has been created with the aim ofestoringhinformation  
about theediagnosis performed by physicians or diagnosticesystems,hincluding informationethat will allow  to keep a tracking about theediagnostichprocess, 
includingeinformation about how a physician or a systemereaches ahdiagnosis. The basicerepresentation of the DPD model can be seen onefigure 4.

In this model, we have a nanopublication collection which represents the input data of the patient. In this collection all the findings 
that the patient manifested and should be considered in the diagnosis process are manifested. On the other hand, we have a nanopublication for each diagnosed disease. 
If a physician or system reaches the decision that several diseases can be the diagnostic result, one nanopublication per disease should be created. 
The nanopublication which contains the diagnosis has the following elements: 
<ul>
<li>Assertion: In the assertion section there is a triple that relates the 
patienth (using the patient ID [subject]) with the proposed disease [object] through the diagnosis relation from the DDxDO ontology.</li> 

<li>Provenance: Provenance 
data provides information about how this diagnosis was reached. First of all, it has direct references to the nanopublication collection that contains 
the data about the patient in order to track where the clinical findings of the patient came from.</li>

Provenance also contains information about what findings help the physician or system to reach the diagnosis. It contains several triples that link 
the diagnosis nanopublication with the supporting nanopublications through the has_clinical_finding relation, being the subject the patient ID and 
the object the supporting nanopublication.
The supporting nanopublications contain information about the finding which helps to reach the diagnosis. Assertion provides triples about what finding was considered (in a positive or negative way) to perform the diagnosis.
Provenance information can contain any other data relevant to the finding such as how it was confirmed.
A working example of the schema with two hypothetical diagnoses for a same input data is shown as follows:
